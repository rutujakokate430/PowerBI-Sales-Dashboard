## Visualizations and Insights  

The dashboard features several interactive visualizations:  

1. **KPI Gauges**:  
   - **Achieved Sales**: Displays total sales achieved (e.g., 13M out of 25M).  
   - **Achieved Profit**: Highlights the total profit achieved (e.g., 1.47M out of 2.93M).  

2. **Card Visuals**:  
   - **Count of Customer Name**: Indicates the total number of unique customers (e.g., 51.29K).  
   - **Sum of Quantity**: Shows the total quantity of products sold (e.g., 178K).  

3. **Line Chart**:  
   - **Sum of Profit and Sum of Sales by Year and Quarter**: Tracks trends in sales and profit over time to identify seasonal growth patterns.  

4. **Pie Chart**:  
   - **Sum of Profit by Category**: Represents profit distribution across product categories like Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies.  

5. **Map Visualization**:  
   - **Sum of Sales and Sum of Profit by Country and Category**: Displays sales and profit across regions on an interactive map for geographical insights.  

6. **Scatter Chart**:  
   - **Average Sales by Category**: Plots the average sales and profit for each product category to highlight performance trends and outliers.  

7. **Funnel Chart**:  
   - **Sum of Discount by Category**: Visualizes the distribution of discounts across product categories.

## Power Query Transformations  

The following transformations were performed in Power Query:  

1. **Data Import**:  
   - Imported datasets from multiple sources such as Excel and SQL Server.  

2. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Removed duplicates and filtered null or invalid values.  
   - Standardized date formats and renamed ambiguous columns for clarity.  

3. **Transformations**:  
   - Merged datasets (e.g., linking sales data with customer and region information).  
   - Created calculated columns for new metrics, such as "Profit Percentage."  
   - Applied data grouping to calculate aggregates like region-wise sales totals.  

4. **Advanced Transformations**:  
   - Unpivoted columns to create a more analysis-friendly data structure.  
   - Added conditional columns to categorize products or territories.

## DAX Calculations  

Dynamic DAX measures and calculations were implemented to enhance dashboard interactivity:  

1. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:  
   - **Total Revenue**: `SUM(Sales[Revenue])`  
   - **Profit Margin**: `DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Profit]), SUM(Sales[Revenue]), 0)`  
   - **Year-over-Year Growth**: `([This Year Revenue] - [Last Year Revenue]) / [Last Year Revenue]`  

2. **Time Intelligence Measures**:  
   - **Year-to-Date Sales**: `TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales[Revenue]), Calendar[Date])`  
   - **Rolling 12-Month Sales**: `CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Revenue]), DATESINPERIOD(Calendar[Date], LASTDATE(Calendar[Date]), -12, MONTH))`  

3. **Dynamic Segmentation**:  
   - Created measures to segment customers based on revenue tiers (e.g., High Value, Mid-Tier, Low Value).  

4. **Custom Metrics**:  
   - **Sales Variance**: Highlights underperforming regions.  
   - **Rankings**: Ranks top-performing products and regions dynamically.
